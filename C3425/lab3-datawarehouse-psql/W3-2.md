Use `\dt` to show tables,  and don't forget to terminate all your SQL  queries with a `;` .Use `f` to page through results and q  to quit the pager.

`dt+` for more information.

Use `\i the_file.txt` to run the commands in the file, thereby creating the table. 

The tables are `counties` and `population` in this lab.
```SQL
CREATE TABLE counties   (county_id int,
			 region integer CHECK (0 < region) CHECK (region < 5),
			 division integer CHECK (0 < division) CHECK (division < 10),
			 state varchar, 
			 county varchar, 
			 PRIMARY KEY (county_id));

CREATE TABLE population (county_id int REFERENCES counties (county_id),
			 year smallint CHECK (2009 < year) CHECK (year < 2017), 
			 eoy_population int CHECK (eoy_population >= 0), 
			 births integer CHECK (births >= 0), 
			 deaths integer CHECK (deaths >= 0), 
			 international_migration integer, 
			 domestic_migration integer, 
			 residual int,
			 PRIMARY KEY (county_id, year));
```

# 1. Aggregation (Roll-Up by dimension reduction) and Cubes

## (2)
`population::  county_id | year | eoy_population | births | deaths | international_migration | domestic_migration | residual`

`counties::  county_id | region | division |        state         |              county`

## (3)
`SELECT year, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY ROLLUP (year);`
```SQL
 year |   sum    | count 
------+----------+-------
      | 24743884 | 21987
 2015 |  3980206 |  3141
 2011 |  3970100 |  3141
 2014 |  3960262 |  3141
 2010 |   987086 |  3141
 2016 |  3974891 |  3141
 2012 |  3933831 |  3141
 2013 |  3937508 |  3141
```
Number of rows = 8 (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT year, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY ROLLUP (year)) as foo;`)
Hey look, it gave us the apex cube. 

## (4)
`SELECT county_id, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY ROLLUP (county_id);`
```SQL
 county_id |   sum    | count 
-----------+----------+-------
           | 24743884 | 21987
       790 |      290 |     7
      2850 |      913 |     7
      1798 |     2437 |     7
      1489 |     1187 |     7
      2335 |     1374 |     7
      1269 |    19620 |     7
... etc
```

Number of rows = 3142 (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT county_id, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY ROLLUP (county_id)) as foo;`)


## (5)
`SELECT county_id, year, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY CUBE (county_id, year);`

Number of rows = 25136 (not 25144...?) (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT county_id, year, SUM(births), COUNT(*) FROM population GROUP BY CUBE (county_id, year)) as foo;`)

Number of rows in `population`: 21987 (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM population;`)

25136 = 1 + 21987 + (8 - 1) + (3142 - 1)

## (6)

The apex cube contains two columns, the SUM of births and COUNT of the rows contributing to that row. The former refers to the total sum of births occurring over all countries over all years. The count refers to the number of rows contributing to that sum, which is equivalent to all the rows in the original, unaggregated table (21987)

# 2. Rollup by climbing up the concept hierarchy, and materialising cubes

Fix: You're only moving along the concept hierarchy, therefore you were not meant to get rid of the year dimension!

county_level: `SELECT * INTO county_level FROM (SELECT county_id, county, state, division, region, year, SUM(births - deaths) as net_nat_change, SUM(domestic_migration + international_migration) as net_migration FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties) as foo ORDER BY county_id;`


state_level: `SELECT * INTO state_level FROM (SELECT state, division, region, year, SUM(net_nat_change) as net_nat_change, SUM(net_migration) as net_migration FROM county_level GROUP BY state, division, region, year) as foo ORDER BY state;`

division_level: `SELECT * INTO division_level FROM (SELECT division, region, year, SUM(net_nat_change) as net_nat_change, SUM(net_migration) as net_migration FROM state_level GROUP BY division, region, year) as foo ORDER BY division;`


region_level: `SELECT * INTO region_level FROM (SELECT region, year, SUM(net_nat_change) as net_nat_change, SUM(net_migration, year) as net_migration FROM division_level GROUP BY region) as foo ORDER BY region;`

Okay, I can't be bothered to rewrite the above.

## Actual Answers:

2.1: SELECT region, division, state, county, year, (births-deaths) AS net_natural, (international_migration + domestic_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_county FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties;

2.2: SELECT region, division, state, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_state FROM new_population_county GROUP BY region, division, state, year;

2.3: SELECT region, division, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_division FROM new_population_state GROUP BY region, division, year;

2.4: SELECT region, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_region FROM new_population_division GROUP BY region, year;

# 3. Querying the Cubes
## (1)
`SELECT AVG(net_migration) FROM new_population_state WHERE year=2015;`
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT AVG(net_migration) FROM new_population_state WHERE year=2015;`
	* Planning Time: 0.077 ms
	* Execution Time: 0.125 ms

SELECT div.region, div.division, (CAST(net_natural AS FLOAT)/ CAST(sub.total_pop AS FLOAT)) AS rate FROM new_population_division div INNER JOIN (SELECT region, division, SUM(eoy_population) As total_pop FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties WHERE year = 2012 GROUP BY region, division) sub ON div.division = sub.division WHERE div.year = 2013 ORDER BY rate DESC;

## (2)
Didn't do this one, because I'm dumb.

This is the provided answer: `SELECT division, net_migration, net_natural FROM new_population_division WHERE year = 2013 AND net_migration > net_natural;`

`SELECT division FROM new_population_division WHERE net_migration>net_natural AND year=2013;` Wait that was way too easy lmfao. 



# 4. Strategy for querying
## (1)

Use the division level. (Correct, BTW)

This is the provided query:
```sql
SELECT div.region, div.division, (CAST(net_natural AS FLOAT)/ CAST(sub.total_pop AS FLOAT)) AS rate FROM new_population_division div INNER JOIN (SELECT region, division, SUM(eoy_population) As total_pop FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties WHERE year = 2012 GROUP BY region, division) sub ON div.division = sub.division WHERE div.year = 2013 ORDER BY rate DESC;
```

We can see that we're essential selecting division and natural / total pop increase. We have the conditions of year=2013. We did an inner join with a table that contains the 2012 eoy population to compare the actual total population increase. 

Hmm, that isn't the rate that I interpreted from the question, but anyways

To find the MAXIMUM rate of population increase... order by rate DESC, and that's how we see the first row.

 * Execution Time: 5.074 ms


## (2)

Unfinished. 

```sql
WITH nat_pop AS (SELECT region, division, CAST(SUM(net_natural) AS FLOAT) AS total_natural FROM new_population_county WHERE year = 2012 GROUP BY region, division), tot_pop AS (SELECT region, division, CAST(SUM(eoy_population) AS FLOAT) AS total_population FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties WHERE year = 2012 GROUP BY region, division) SELECT division, total_natural / total_population AS rate FROM nat_pop NATURAL JOIN tot_pop ORDER BY rate DESC;
```
* Planning Time: 0.455 ms
* Execution Time: 10.247 ms

Execution time increases when we use population_county, which is a less aggregated version and contains too much detail as required in the county cube. 

## (3)
"Build another cube that contains the total end of year population aggregated to division level and then try re-evaluating the query on the new cube joined to one of your other cubes. Does this speed it up even further?"

total_eoy_population:
```sql
SELECT division, year, CAST(SUM(eoy_population) AS FLOAT) AS total_population INTO total_eoy_population FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties GROUP BY division, year;
```

`SELECT div.region, div.division, 

SELECT division, region, CAST(SUM(net_natural) AS FLOAT) / eoy_population AS rate FROM new_population_division NATURAL JOIN total_eoy_population WHERE year=2013 GROUP BY division, region ORDER BY rate DESC;


WITH nat_pop AS (SELECT region, division, CAST(SUM(net_natural) AS FLOAT) AS total_natural FROM new_population_division WHERE year = 2012 GROUP BY region, division) SELECT division, total_natural / total_population AS rate FROM nat_pop NATURAL JOIN total_eoy_population ORDER BY rate DESC;

 Planning Time: 0.197 ms
 Execution Time: 0.168 ms

### Answer:
`SELECT div.region, div.division, CAST(net_natural AS FLOAT)/CAST(total_population AS FLOAT) AS rate FROM new_population_division div INNER JOIN total_eoy_population pop ON div.division = pop.division WHERE div.year = 2013 and pop.year = 2012 ORDER BY rate DESC;`

Essentially, we have made the replacement from the first query. 

# 5. Iceberg cubes 
We only revise to the division aggregate;


2.1: SELECT region, division, state, county, year, (births-deaths) AS net_natural, (international_migration + domestic_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_county FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties WHERE domestic_migration + international_migration > 10000;

2.2: SELECT region, division, state, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_state FROM new_population_county GROUP BY region, division, state, year;

2.3: SELECT region, division, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_division FROM new_population_state GROUP BY region, division, year;

2.4: SELECT region, year, SUM(net_natural) AS net_natural, SUM(net_migration) AS net_migration INTO new_population_region FROM new_population_division GROUP BY region, year;

When we rerun the first query in Q3, we get:
 Planning Time: 0.386 ms
 Execution Time: 4.278 ms

We've saved about 10-20%. 

### FIX:
`SELECT region, division, state, county, year, SUM (domestic_migration + international_migration) AS net_migration INTO largest_migration FROM population NATURAL JOIN counties WHERE (domestic_migration + international_migration) > 10000 GROUP BY ROLLUP (region, division, state, county, year);`

At this point I don't even understand what this question is asking. 
But, I did entirely miss the ROLLUP bit, I don't understand what this roll-up query means!
