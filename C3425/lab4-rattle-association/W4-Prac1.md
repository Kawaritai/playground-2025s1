Using Rattle and the provided Association Mining Practical: Reference, use the Movies dataset to answer the following questions.

# Understanding the data:

## (a) How are transactions represented in this data set?

## (b) How many transactions does the data set contain?




# Frequency plot:

## (c) What does rattle list on the x-axis of a frequency plot?

## (d) Which items have equal frequency in the dataset? What are their relative frequencies?

## (e) Looking at the default graph, which setting should be changed to show only the three most frequent items? What value should this setting be changed to?




# Association rules:

## (f) Using rattleâ€™s default settings. How many association rules are generated for this data set? How are these rules sorted?

## (g) How does Rattle visualise association rules? What do the arrows mean?

## ( h ) What value of Min Length will generate association rules with an empty left-hand side? What is the meaning of these rules?

## (i) What values would you set to get rules that appear in at least a quarter of all transactions?

## (j) Can you generate a set of interesting/useful (?) set of rules? What are the settings used to produce this set of rules?
