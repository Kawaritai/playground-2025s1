# R Tutorials
## Tutorial 1: R Introduction
* Stored objects:
  * There are already a large number of stored objects available with standard R and RStudio –these are located somewhere in your search path. Type search() to see which packages arealready included in your search path. The ls() or list command will list the contents of thepackages in your search path. By default, ls() lists the contents of position 1, ls(pos=1), whichis where objects you create are stored, but you can ask for a listing of any package; forexample, ls(pos=“package:datasets”) will show you the sample datasets that come withstandard R. Type help(search), help(ls) and help(dataset name) for further details.Note that items higher up the search path (in a package with a lower position number) will befound first and will effectively mask objects of the same name that are located further downthe search path.
  * ls(), search(), and masking, objects()
* TODO: Worth going through Exercise 3 here. 

## Tutorial 2
* Question 1 is just easy `lm()` fitting and plotting.
* TODO: Do Question 2 (equation work)
## Tutorial 3
* TODO: Do all questions - this is ANOVA. 
## Tutorial 4
* TODO: For extra practice, see if you can SPEED do this! Say, 15 minutes. 
## Tutorial 5: Sample assignment
* Just a sample assignment, there's nothing to do. However, notice that the solution itself has plenty of useful R code.
